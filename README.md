# Overview

In order to continue learning, it is important to log what I am able to do. I am going back to the basics and creating a simple "Hello World!" file.

My software for this week is a simple python program that gives the classic "Hello World!" output with my own personal flair.

I created this software to act as a quick reminder of how to print to a terminal in python.

Here is a video of me demonstrating my software: [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/a99ccWpyTDM)

# Development Environment

To develop this program I used Microsoft Visual Studio and GitHub.

This code was done using the Python programming language.
